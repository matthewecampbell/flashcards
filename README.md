#Flash Cards

This project was built in my first week at Turing School of Software and Design.  It is a command-line based application that allows you to
create flash cards and study them.  The app will let you know if you got the answer correct or incorrect and will give you a percentage
correct when you finish all of the cards.  If you get a card wrong, the application will put the card at the back of the deck for further study.
